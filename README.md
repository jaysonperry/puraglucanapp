This app is devloped by Mediapack, Inc., a Web Application Development firm out of Silicon Beach.

Both founders, Sandy Fischler and Jayson Perry, come from long tenures in the sports events and music industries. Now turning their attention to developing marketing strategies with supporting apps that help with communicating the fundemental answer to, "What's in it for you, the customer?"

What we do is help you tell others how you, your product, or your service helps them out of a jam. That's about it!
